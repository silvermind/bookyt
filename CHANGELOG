This is yet another security update fixing a critical issue. You should update

If you do not update, attackers might work around access restrictions, run code
on your webservers and much more. Take it seriously!

There's been a number of security updates in the last few weeks. This is the
result of a critical view on some parts of the underlying framework Ruby on Rails.
While the high number of issues is disturbing, it is also a sign that the
framework is actually reviewed and flaws are found and fixed.

There is also a point release 1.4.7 for those who stay on Ruby 1.8 or like to stay
on Bookyt 1.4 for some reason.

1.5.0

We provide a major rework of the Bank Statement importer. It's now possible

Ruby 1.9.3 now. We might revert these changes if someone helps us with keeping
1.8.7 support;-)

We reworked our internal deployment at CyT and now use Unicorn, Bluepill, and
capistrano. We checked in some files to support that. Just ask if you'd like to
use those. We might add some words about it in the readme...

password hashes, implement keylogger, and even run code as the user your
webserver runs. Take it seriously!

A productivity boosting interface to assign invoices to payment booking
is my personal favorite:-)

Give it a try at https://bookyt-demo.cyt.ch!

  by ESR.

  right side

1.3.2
=====
Tracking expenses with VAT got much, much easier. We've built a custom
form helping you to enter all those retailer recipes quickly.

Some bugfixes and the possibility to specify since when timesheets
should calculate the saldo for employees also made it into this release.

To support you setting up your own instance, join us on the following
channels:
* IRC:         freenode.net #bookyt
* Mailinglist: http://groups.google.com/group/bookyt
* Mail:        info@cyt.ch

Other notable changes:
* Fix invoice filter in people view.
* Include account code in account comboboxes in booking forms.

1.3.1
=====
We've given the timetracking module some love: filters in lists,
clever forms to do batch entries, nicer timelog. Directly printing
pages and reports in the browser now works great even in tabbed views.
Better view and form headings quickly tell you what you look at.
The salary pay slips had a major bugfix regarding bad rounding.

We have some great news for developers, too: We're working hard to
make contributing easy: some new helpers simplify
building new views; using great gems like inherited_resources make
controllers simple to understand, adapt, and build.

Of course our code is available commit by commit as soon as we code
it at https://github.com/huerlisi/bookyt.

Other bugfixes:
* Fix page header if not logged in
* Salary items show badly rounded amount in pay slip
* Invoice update sometimes fails validation for no obvious reason

* Render list even if empty in generic index view
* Fix untranslated strings
* Fixed form for Bank Accounts

1.3.0

We streamlined the interface and made it much nicer on smaller devices
like tablets and phones.

Beside dozens of usability fixes, balance/profit sheet reporting got
much more powerful. We now provide year by year comparison and better
print support. Search result now provide more information and all
sidebar filters are now unified in look and functionality.

Enabling mobile devices has been simplified tremendously by open source
components like Twitter Bootstrap 2 and simple_form. A big "Thank You!"
to all those involved in these and other projects!

Check it out, it's the best Bookyt ever:-)

1.2.2
=====
Another polishing release. It's the little things that make a big
difference!

Using zebrastriped lists is a small thing, but enhances usability
quite a bit. Better translations make it simpler to find what
you're looking for. Hints when a list contains no items tell you
why this list exists in the first place. Unified, cleaner design
of sidebar filters and pagers tell you what you see in no time.

And much more...

Check it out at https://bookyt-demo.cyt.ch!

Other Improvements:
* Much nicer and consistent booking entry

Major bugfixes:
* In invoice forms, the 'total' in the line item footer did not update,
  using a generic saldo line item now
* Manual bookings could get lost if assigned invoice gets updated

  value date.

1.2.1
=====
Mainly focusing on small usability bugs and enhancements.

One outstanding feature did slip in though: not matching payments
bookings, imported from bank, can now be cleaned up by simply
clicking on action buttons. You may write off, book as extra
earning etc.

Oh, yes! There's another one: most pages will now produce sensible
print outs. Simply use your browsers 'print' action or press
<ctrl-p>.

Give it a try at https://bookyt-demo.cyt.ch!

Other Improvements:

bit of information. It's currently tailored to swiss law, but the
framework will handle other requirements with ease.

language switcher.

Invoices can now contain summary line items and calculations for relative
amounts are done in realtime while entering data.
